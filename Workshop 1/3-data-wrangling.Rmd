# Session 3 

**Wrangling your data into shape for analysis**

(If you re-started RStudio, be sure to re-open your project too.)

# Using the packages tidyr, dplyr, purrr

- Writing readable code using **pipes**
- What is **tidy data**? Why do you want tidy data? Getting your data into tidy form using tidyr.
- **Summarise, mutate, filter, select, arrange** with dplyr
- Reading different **data formats**
- String operations, working with **text**
- Re-structuring **time** variables
- Computing on **lists** with purrr (not covered)
- Handling **missing values** (not covered)

# Pipes `%>%`

Pipes allow the code to be read like a sequence of operations

```{r echo=FALSE}
workers <- read_csv(file="data/Assembled_Workers__Compensation_Claims___Beginning_2000.csv")
```

```{r}
# Instead of table(workers$Gender)
workers %>% 
  group_by(Gender) %>% 
  tally()
```

#

```{r}
# Instead of 
# mean(workers$`Birth Year`, na.rm=TRUE)
# sd(workers$`Birth Year`, na.rm=TRUE)
workers %>% 
  group_by(Gender) %>% 
  filter(Gender %in% c("F", "M")) %>%
  summarise(m=mean(`Birth Year`, na.rm=TRUE), 
            s=sd(`Birth Year`, na.rm=TRUE))
```

# Warmups - Problem 1

What are the variables?

```{r echo=FALSE}
grad <- read_csv("data/graduate-programs.csv")
kable(head(grad[c(2,3,4,6)]))
```

# Warmups - Problem 2

What's in the column names of this data? What are the experimental units? What are the measured variables?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
genes <- read_csv("data/genes.csv")
kable(genes)
```

# Warmups - Problem 3

How many ways can you write today's date?

# Warmups - Problem 4

What are the variables? What are the records?

```{r}
melbtemp <- read.fwf("data/ASN00086282.dly", 
   c(11, 4, 2, 4, rep(c(5, 1, 1, 1), 31)), fill=T)
kable(head(melbtemp[,c(1,2,3,4,seq(5,128,4))]))
```

# Warmups - Problem 5

What are the variables? What are the experimental units?

```{r}
tb <- read_csv("data/tb.csv")
#tail(tb)
colnames(tb)
```

# Warmups - Problem 6

What are the variables? What are the experimental units?

```{r}
pew <- read.delim(
  file = "http://stat405.had.co.nz/data/pew.txt",
  header = TRUE,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
  check.names = F
)
kable(pew[1:5, 1:5])
```

# Warmups - Problem 7

10 week sensory experiment, 12 individuals assessed taste of french fries on several scales (how potato-y, buttery, grassy, rancid, paint-y do they taste?), fried in one of 3 different oils, replicated twice. First few rows:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data(french_fries, package = "reshape2")
kable(head(french_fries, 4), format = "markdown", row.names = F)
```

What is the experimental unit? What are the factors of the experiment? What was measured? What do you want to know?

# Messy data patterns

There are various features of messy data that one can observe in practice. Here are some of the more commonly observed patterns.

- Column headers are values, not variable names
- Variables are stored in both rows and columns, contingency table format
- One type of experimental unit stored in multiple tables
- Dates in many different formats

# What is tidy data?

- Each observation forms a row
- Each variable forms a column
- Contained in a single table
- Long form makes it easier to reshape in many different ways
- Wide form is common for analysis

# Tidy data

![](lego.pdf)

# Messy data

![](playmobile.pdf)

# Tidy verbs

- **gather**: specify the **keys** (identifiers) and the **values** (measures) to make long form (used to be called melting)
- **spread**: variables in columns (used to be called casting)
- nest/unnest: working with lists
- separate/unite: split and combine columns

# French fries - hot chips

10 week sensory experiment, 12 individuals assessed taste of french fries on several scales (how potato-y, buttery, grassy, rancid, paint-y do they taste?), fried in one of 3 different oils, replicated twice. First few rows:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
kable(head(french_fries), format = "markdown", row.names = FALSE)
```

# What would we like to know?

- Is the design complete?
- Are replicates like each other?
- How do the ratings on the different scales differ?
- Are raters giving different scores on average?
- Do ratings change over the weeks?

Each of these questions involves different summaries of the data.

# Gathering

- When gathering, you need to specify the **keys** (identifiers) and the **values** (measures).

Keys/Identifiers:
- Identify a record (must be unique)
- Example: Indices on an random variable
- Fixed by design of experiment (known in advance)
- May be single or composite (may have one or more variables)

Values/Measures:
- Collected during the experiment (not known in advance)
- Usually numeric quantities

# Gathering the French Fries

```{r}
ff_long <- gather(french_fries, key = variable, value = 
                    rating, potato:painty)
head(ff_long)
```

# Long to Wide

In certain applications, we may wish to take a long dataset and convert it to a wide dataset (perhaps displaying in a table).

This is called "spreading" the data.

# Spread

We use the **spread** function from tidyr to do this:

```{r}
french_fries_wide <- spread(ff_long, key = variable, 
                            value = rating)

head(french_fries_wide)
```

# Gather and spread to answer some questions

- Easiest question to start is whether the ratings are similar on the different scales, potato'y, buttery, grassy, rancid and painty. 

- We need to gather the data into long form, and make plots facetted by the scale. 

# Ratings on the different scales

```{r}
ff.m <- french_fries %>% 
  gather(type, rating, -subject, -time, -treatment, -rep)
head(ff.m)
```

#

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=8}
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=2) + 
  facet_wrap(~type, ncol=5) 
```

# Side-by-side boxplots

```{r}
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=type, y=rating, fill=type)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```


# Do the replicates look like each other?

We will start to tackle this by plotting the replicates against each other using a scatterplot. 

We need to gather the data into long form, and then get the replicates spread into separate columns. 

# Check replicates

```{r}
head(ff.m)
ff.s <- ff.m %>% spread(rep, rating)
head(ff.s)
```

# Check replicates

```{r, fig.show='hold', fig.align='default', fig.height=2, fig.width=2}
ggplot(data=ff.s, aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1) + xlab("Rep 1") + ylab("Rep 2")
ggplot(data=ff.s, aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1) + xlab("Rep 1") + ylab("Rep 2") + 
  scale_x_sqrt() + scale_y_sqrt()
```

# Your turn

Make the scatterplots of reps against each other separately for scales, and treatment. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=ff.s, aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1) + 
  xlab("Rep 1") + ylab("Rep 2") + facet_wrap(~type, ncol=5)
ggplot(data=ff.s, aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1) + 
  xlab("Rep 1") + ylab("Rep 2") + facet_grid(treatment~type)
```

# Your turn

Read in the billboard top 100 music data, which contains N'Sync and Backstreet Boys songs that entered the billboard charts in the year 2000

```{r}
billboard <- read.csv("data/billboard.csv")
```

What's in this data? What's X1-X76?

# Your turn

1. Use `tidyr` to convert this data into a long format appropriate for plotting a time series (date on the x axis, chart position on the y axis)
2. Use `ggplot2` to create this time series plot:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
long_billboard <- gather(billboard, key = week, value = rank, X1:X76)
long_billboard$week <- as.numeric(gsub("X", "", long_billboard$week))

ggplot(data = long_billboard, aes(x=week, y=rank, colour = artist, group = track)) + geom_line() + theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

# dplyr verbs
 
The package dplyr helps to make various summaries of the data. There are five primary dplyr **verbs**, representing distinct data analysis tasks:

- **Filter**: Remove the rows of a data frame, producing subsets
- **Arrange**: Reorder the rows of a data frame
- **Select**: Select particular columns of a data frame
- **Mutate**: Add new columns that are functions of existing columns
- **Summarise**: Create collapsed summaries of a data frame

# The Split-Apply-Combine Approach

![](split-apply-combine.png)

(Diagram originally from Hadley Wickham)

# Split-Apply-Combine in dplyr

```{r}
french_fries_split <- group_by(ff_long, variable) # SPLIT
french_fries_apply <- summarise(french_fries_split, 
     rating = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE)) # APPLY + COMBINE
french_fries_apply
```
    
# Filter

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    filter(subject == 3, time == 1)
```

# Arrange

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    arrange(desc(rancid)) %>%
    head
```

# Select

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    select(time, treatment, subject, rep, potato) %>%
    head
```

# Summarise

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    group_by(time, treatment) %>%
    summarise(mean_rancid = mean(rancid), 
              sd_rancid = sd(rancid))
```

# Answering remaining french fries questions

If the data is complete it should be 12 x 10 x 3 x 2, that is, 6 records for each person. (Assuming that each person rated on all scales.) 

To check this we want to tabulate the number of records for each subject, time and treatment. This means select appropriate columns, tabulate, count and spread it out to give a nice table.

# Check completeness

```{r}
french_fries %>% 
  select(subject, time, treatment) %>% 
  tbl_df() %>% 
  count(subject, time) %>%
  spread(time, n) %>% kable
```

# Check completeness with different scales, too

```{r}
french_fries %>% 
  gather(type, rating, -subject, -time, -treatment, -rep) %>%
  select(subject, time, treatment, type) %>% 
  tbl_df() %>% 
  count(subject, time) %>%
  spread(time, n) %>% kable
```

# Change in ratings over weeks

```{r, fig.show='hide'}
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(time, rating, colour=treatment)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(subject~type) 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ff.m %>% filter((type %in% c("buttery", "painty")) & (subject %in% c("3", "10"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(time, rating, colour=treatment)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(subject~type) 
```

# Add means over reps, and connect the dots

```{r, fig.show='hide'}
ff.m.av <- ff.m %>% 
  group_by(subject, time, type, treatment) %>%
  summarise(rating=mean(rating))
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(time, rating, colour=treatment)) + 
  geom_point() +  facet_grid(subject~type) +
  geom_line(data=ff.m.av, aes(group=treatment))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ff.m.av <- ff.m %>% 
  filter((type %in% c("buttery", "painty")) & (subject %in% c("3", "10"))) %>%
  group_by(subject, time, type, treatment) %>%
  summarise(rating=mean(rating))
ff.m %>% filter((type %in% c("buttery", "painty")) & (subject %in% c("3", "10"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(time, rating, colour=treatment)) + 
  geom_point() +  facet_grid(subject~type) +
  geom_line(data=ff.m.av, aes(group=treatment))
```

# String manipulation

When the experimental design is packed into column names, we need to extract it, and tidy it up. 

```{r}
genes <- read_csv("data/genes.csv")
kable(head(genes))
```

# Gather column names into long form

```{r}
gather(genes, variable, expr, -id) %>% kable
```

# Separate columns

```{r}
genes %>%
  gather(variable, expr, -id) %>%
  separate(variable, c("trt", "leftover"), "-") %>%
  kable
```

#

```{r}
genes %>%
  gather(variable, expr, -id) %>%
  separate(variable, c("trt", "leftover"), "-") %>%
  separate(leftover, c("time", "rep"), "\\.") %>% kable
```

#

```{r}
gtidy <- genes %>%
  gather(variable, expr, -id) %>%
  separate(variable, c("trt", "leftover"), "-") %>%
  separate(leftover, c("time", "rep"), "\\.") %>%
  mutate(trt = sub("W", "", trt)) %>%
  mutate(rep = sub("R", "", rep))
kable(head(gtidy))
```

# Your turn

(1) Using the tidied dataset (`gtidy`), find the mean expression for each combination of id, trt, and time.
(2) Use this tidied data to make this plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=2}
gmean <- gtidy %>% 
  group_by(id, trt, time) %>% 
  summarise(expr = mean(expr))
ggplot(data = gtidy, aes(trt, expr, colour = time)) + 
         geom_point() + 
  xlab("Type of modification") + ylab("Expression") + 
  facet_wrap(~id) +
  geom_line(data = gmean, aes(group = time))
```

# Re-structuring the temperature data

```{r}
melbtemp.m <- melbtemp %>%
  select(num_range("V", c(1,2,3,4,seq(5,128,4)))) %>%
  filter(V4 %in% c("PRCP", "TMAX", "TMIN")) %>%
  gather(day, value, V5:V125, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  spread(V4, value) %>%
  mutate(
    tmin = as.numeric(TMIN) / 10,
    tmax = as.numeric(TMAX) / 10,
    t_range = tmax - tmin,
    prcp = as.numeric(PRCP) / 10
  ) %>%
  rename(stn=V1, year=V2, month=V3)
```

#

```{r}
kable(head(melbtemp.m))
```

#

```{r}
melbtemp.m$day <- factor(melbtemp.m$day, 
  levels=c("V5","V9","V13","V17","V21","V25","V29",
           "V33","V37","V41","V45","V49","V53","V57",
           "V61","V65","V69","V73","V77","V81","V85",
           "V89","V93","V97","V101","V105","V109",
           "V113","V117","V121","V125"),
  labels=1:31)
melbtemp.m$date <- as.Date(paste(melbtemp.m$day, 
     melbtemp.m$month, melbtemp.m$year, sep="-"),
     "%d-%m-%Y")
```

#

```{r}
kable(head(melbtemp.m))
```

# Re-structuring tuberculosis data

```{r}
tb_tidy <- tb %>%
  gather(demographic, cases, m_04:f_u, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  separate(demographic, c("sex", "age"), "_") %>%
  rename(country = iso2) %>%
  arrange(country, year, sex, age) 
kable(head(tb_tidy))
```

# Dates and Times

Dates are deceptively hard to work with.

**Example**: 02/05/2012. Is it February 5th, or May 2nd?

Other things are difficult too:

- Time zones
- POSIXct format in base R is challenging

The **lubridate**, and **timeDate** package helps tackle some of these issues.

# Basic Lubridate Use

```{r}
now()
today()
now() + hours(4)
today() - days(2)
```

# Parsing Dates

```{r}
ymd("2013-05-14")
mdy("05/14/2013")
dmy("14052013")
ymd_hms("2013:05:14 14:5:30", tz = "Australia/Melbourne")
```

# Extracting temporal elements

```{r}
month(ymd("2013-05-14"))
year(ymd("2013-05-14"))
wday(ymd("2013-05-14"), label=TRUE, abbr=TRUE)
isWeekday(ymd("2013-05-14"))
```

# NY Workers Compensation

```{r}
workers$`Accident Date` <- as.Date(workers$`Accident Date`,
                                    format="%m/%d/%Y")
summary(workers$`Accident Date`)
```

#

```{r}
workers$year <- year(workers$`Accident Date`)
summary(workers$year)
workers %>% group_by(year) %>% tally() %>% kable
```

#

There should not be any claims before 2000, these are mistakes. Need to filter out the rows where `year < 2000`

#

```{r}
workers$month <- month(workers$`Accident Date`, 
                       label=TRUE, abbr=TRUE)
summary(workers$month)
```

#

```{r}
workers$wday <- wday(workers$`Accident Date`, 
                     label=TRUE, abbr=TRUE)
summary(workers$wday)
workers$timeindx <- as.numeric(workers$`Accident Date`-
        as.Date("01/01/2000", format="%m/%d/%Y"))
```

# When do claims get made - by year

```{r}
ws <- workers %>% filter(year > 1999)
ggplot(ws, aes(x=year)) + geom_bar()
```

# by month

```{r}
ggplot(ws, aes(x=month)) + geom_bar()
```

# by day

```{r}
ws$wday <- factor(ws$wday, levels=levels(ws$wday)[c(2:7,1)])
ggplot(ws, aes(x=wday)) + geom_bar()
```

# Your turn

- Make a plot to examine the type of claim by year. 
- Make a plot to examine the claims by gender by year. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
ggplot(ws, aes(x=year, fill=`Claim Type`)) + geom_bar()
ws %>% filter(Gender %in% c("F", "M")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, fill=Gender)) + geom_bar(position="fill")
```

# Reading different file formats

- save, load: functions that allow you to save an R object, and load it back to R later
- fixed width fields: `read.fwf()`
- fixed width formats with SAS DATA script: `library(SAScii)`
- SPSS, Stata, SAS: `library(haven)`
- minitab, S, SAS, SPSS, systat, weka, dBase `library(foreign)`; SAS `library(SASxport)`
- googlesheets `library(googlesheets)`; html/web pages `library(rvest)`; images `library(EBImage)`;  sound `library(tuneR)`; netCDF `library(ncdf)`; hdf5 `library(hdf5)`; json `library(jsonlite)`; 
- economic data `library(quantmod)`
